We are building a collective of Cambridge/Boston-based PhD, MD, and MBA trainees motivated by value creation rooted in biotechnological innovation, known as the Area Two Bio Fund. The primary goals of the fund are long-term growth of capital and education in public investing and biotechnology of its partners.

We will leverage our diverse expertise, ranging from engineering development to clinical translation to business implementation, to inform public investing decisions across biotechnology sectors and life sciences. 

The Area Two Bio Fund is a general partnership investment fund. Partners enter and exit the Fund through shares. Ownership of shares represents an obligation to participate in the Fund’s investment decisions through voting. Investment opportunities are presented to the Fund as pitches created by individual partners or teams, organized and driven by a core strategy team. Trades are executed by the Fund’s broker, in collaboration with the Executor and CFO.

Information provided may be out-of-date or inaccurate. Individual partners are not liable for capital losses incurred by the Area Two Bio Fund. Any past performance is not indicative of future results. Investing is risky. This is not an advertisement for securities.
