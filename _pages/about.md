We are a collective of Cambridge/Boston-based PhD, MD, and MBA trainees motivated by value creation rooted in biotechnological innovation, known as the Area Two Bio Fund. The primary goals of the fund are long-term growth of capital and education in public investing and biotechnology of its partners.

We will leverage our diverse expertise, ranging from engineering development to clinical translation to business implementation, to inform public investing decisions across biotechnology sectors and life sciences.
